# Use one of Niklas' vulnerability detection LLMs
# and perform a simple experiment using two sizes of context
# one large enough and one obviously too small
#
# a simple jailbreak is also possible -> huge Jailbreak does not fit into small context
# or use a vulnerability detection LLM with different context sizes
