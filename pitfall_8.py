# use code snippet with a vulnerability, ask GPT if the vulnerability is present. 
# Then change superficial features and ask again. If GPT says no, then we've proven that the detection
# relies on superficial features instead of the actual vulnerabilities.

# same applies for my (Jonathan's) paper and LLMs wich are not able to use tools properly and therefore seem to be robbust
